## Abstract

This specification establishes a common vocabulary and standardized definitions for terms used across chat protocol specifications. It serves as a normative reference to ensure consistent interpretation of terminology across application level specifications.

## Background / Rationale / Motivation

Chat protocol specifications often employ similar terminology with subtle but important semantic differences. The absence of standardized definitions leads to ambiguity in specification interpretation and implementation inconsistencies across different protocol variants.

Establishing a shared definitions document provides several benefits:

1. **Semantic Consistency**: Ensures uniform interpretation of common terms across multiple specifications
2. **Implementation Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity for protocol implementers
3. **Specification Quality**: Enables more precise and concise specification language through reference to established definitions
4. **Ecosystem Coherence**: Promotes consistent understanding within the chat protocol ecosystem.

This specification provides normative definitions that other chat protocol specifications MAY reference to establish precise semantic meaning for common terminology.

## Theory / Semantics

### Definition Categories

Terms are organized into the following categories for clarity and ease of reference:

- **Roles**: Defined entity types that determine how a participant behaves within a communication protocol.
- **Message Types**: Classifications and categories of protocol messages
- **Transports**: Abstract methods of transmitting payloads

## Definitions

### Accounts + Identity

### Roles

**Sender**: A client which is pushing a payload on to the network, to one or more recipients.

**Recipient**: A client which is the intended receiver of a payload. In a group context there maybe multiple recipients 

**Participant**: A generic term for the rightful members of a conversation. Senders and Recipients are roles that participants can hold.

### Message Types

The term "message" often has multiple meanings depending on context. The following definitions are used to disambiguate between different abstraction levels. 

**Content**: The data that is intended for end-users or applications - this includes text, images and other user valued data. These messages originate from the application, and are ultimately delivered to other applications. 

**Frame**: The data generated by a chat protocol. Frames are messages used by protocols to provide functionality - they are how clients exchange information with each other and coordinate state.

**Payload**: The encoded data or data structures used by lower layer protocols. This includes the encoded bytes passed to a delivery service or subsequent layers. Payloads are usually associated with the delivery process, which is not defined by chat protocols.


Other specific message types include:

**Content Type**: The structured format of content. These data structures represent specific encodings of Text, Image, Audio data. 

**Delivery Acknowledgement**: A notification from a receiving client to sender that their message was successfully received. While similar to a read-receipt delivery acknowledgements differ in that the acknowledgement originates based on the client, where read-receipts are fired when they are displayed to a user.

**Invite**: A frame used to initialize a new conversation. Invites notify a client that someone wants to communicate with them, and provides the required information to do so.


### Transports

**Out-of-Band**: The transfer of information using a channel separate from the defined chat protocol. Data sent Out-of-Band is transmitted using an undefined mechanism. This is used when protocols requires information to be shared with another entity, but it does not describe how that should occur. The responsibility to define how this occurs is the implementer or other protocols in the suite. 


### Software Entities

**Client**: A Software component that provides messaging capabilities to Applications. Clients are responsible for establishing and maintaining communication with the underlying network, performing protocol operations (e.g., encryption, key management, frame generation), and exposing an interface for higher-level software.

**Application**: Software that integrates with a Client in order to send and receive content. Applications are responsible for displaying content and controlling what content gets sent. 



## Wire Format Specification / Syntax

This specification does not define wire format elements. All definitions are semantic and apply to the interpretation of terms used in other specifications that do define wire formats.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

This specification defines terminology only and does not introduce security or privacy considerations beyond those present in specifications that reference these definitions.

The definitions provided in this specification do not alter the security or privacy properties of implementations that adopt the defined terminology.
